Implementation of the Convex Hull problem 

So far I have used the Jarvis March algorithm (also known as the gift warpping algorithm)

The main problem of this is to find smallest convex polygon that can enclose all the given points in a 2D plane. 

This the input along with the solution put in desmos to display its accuracy, however I am currently working on displaying it based on the solution in an html file, currently the display html file is just a static image of a predetermined input however I am trying to have it show the algorithm searching. (Probably thorugh implementing the alogirhtm a third time in javascript)
