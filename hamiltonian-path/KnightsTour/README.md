This is a C program that solves the Knight's Tour problem using a backtracking approach. The program finds a solution for the Knight's Tour problem on an 8x8 chessboard where a knight must visit every square exactly once, moving according to the rules of a knight in chess.

## Problem Overview

The Knight's Tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. The knight's move is unique in that it can move in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and one square in a perpendicular direction, or vice versa.

The program is designed to solve the problem using a backtracking algorithm, which tries to explore every possible move, but backtracks if it hits a dead-end.
